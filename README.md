The folder named "CNN" contains the result of ResNet-18 training in a folder named 0603.
The other folders are failed or experiments that were not mentioned in the reports.

To make a folder for Spike-Driven codes, every code and file is copied from the original folder on the SUNY Korea BCL research Lab server, as it is being used by multiple users.
To train the Spike-driven network, Spike-Driven/Myeongjun/train.sh is being used.
Training results are saved in Myeongjun/RESULTS folder.
